  description: "<p>Android Architecture Components is a set of libraries for designing great apps. It contains APIs for implementing concepts like Lifecycle and ViewModel.<br />Whilst these APIs are great, they do come with some questions:<ul><li>How do Lifecycle, LiveData and ViewModels work under the hood? How and where should each of them be used?</li><li>What is the difference between a ViewModel from Architecture Components and the one from the MVVM pattern?</li><li>Lifecycle components exist for Activities, Fragments and Application. Why don’t we have the same for Views?</li><li>Can we have ViewModels for Views also?</li><li>Is LiveData a replacement for RxJava? Can they live side by side?</li><li>How does LiveData work with DataBinding?</li><li>How should view state be handled and what goes into a Bundle versus a ViewModel?</li></ul>To answer all of these questions and more we’ll do a deep dive in the internals of Lifecycle, LiveData and ViewModels.</p>"

  title: "Storing and displaying data with Room and Paging"
  description: "<p>Did you know that deleting a “?” can make your app crash? Making a nullable object non-null in a Room Entity class leads to a change in the database schema that consequently requires you to implement a migration. This answer only leads to more questions:<ul><li>How does Room create tables?</li><li>How does it check the validity of the schema and knows which migrations to trigger?</li><li>How are transactions handled?</li><li>Is @Relation actually creating a relation between two tables?</li></ul>To answer all of these questions we’ll do a deep dive into Room’s API. By understanding how it works under the hood, you’ll get a better grasp of Room’s capabilities and limitations.<br /><br />Now that you have data stored in Room, you probably need to display a list based on the database content. The Paging Library can help with this but it also brings a series of new questions:<ul><li>How does Paging work with Room?</li><li>Can Paging be used with data coming from the network or from a database backed by network?</li><li>Who handles the threading of the operations, and how?</li></ul>You’ll first get to know the Paging API and then I’ll show you the inner wiring and how it connects everything together.</p>"

  title: "Check your app's vitals"
  description: "<p>There are four primary vital signs: body temperature, blood pressure, pulse (heart rate), and breathing rate (respiratory rate).<br /><br />Can we identify basic signals that would show us the health of an Android app? How about checking for common problems, such as battery drain, jank, crash rate and excessive network usage?<br /><br />Of course, no amount of local testing under laboratory conditions can identify these problems reliably, not with a limited number of devices and users. That's why it's better to check vitals on a living organism, or in this case, an app that is released to users. Open Android Vitals on the Google Play Console to find out about real issues that real users are encountering in the wild.<br /><br />Requiring no special instrumentation from your side, you will get detailed alerts about stuck wakelocks, wrong wakeup and network usage patterns and many more known bad behaviors.<br /><br />But diagnosing the problems is just half of the solution. During this session I will show tools and techniques on how to deal with the issues using tools that we have at our disposal, such as Android Profilers, Systrace, Strict mode, Battery Historian and more.</p>"

  title: "The bytecode gobbledygook"
  description: "<p>We know one of the main characteristics of Java is portability, and that usually means it is not as efficient as it should be. That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.<br /><br />Compilers that produce native machine code do a great optimization job because they know where the code is going to be executed. But because of the portability feature, the Java Compiler could not assume anything about where our program is going to run and leaves all the optimizations to be done by the JVM while loading or, even, running our code. This has been the case until Google introduced Jack and Jill compilers, but now that has already deprecated them in favour of Java 8 tooling and introducing the new D8 compiler, will this assumption still be true? Also, with the recent addition of Kotlin, there is another language that generates bytecode. How will it perform compared with plain Java code?<br /><br />In this session, you will not only learn what to avoid when looking for critical performance, you’ll also get a bigger understanding of how the java compiler works</p>"

  description: "<p>Android Studio is a build system-centric IDE, where Gradle is the source of truth. This decision was made when we started Android Studio back in 2013, with the following benefits in mind:<ul><li>1. IDE configuration files (IML files) are generated when syncing a project with Gradle. Developers no longer have to manually edit IML files.</li><li>2. By delegating builds to Gradle, build output will be the same regardless of where the build is executed: IDE, command line or CI server.</li></ul>Even though we delivered on these promises, there is still friction between the IDE and Gradle, making the user experience not awesome:<ul><li>1. Syncing a project (with Gradle) is slow</li><li>2. Project synchronization has to be manually started.</li><li>3. Editing build.gradle files is not trivial</li><li>4. There is no way to visualize the structure of a project: a full dependency graph, how build variants are composed, etc.</li><li>5. Importing big projects (100+ modules) makes the IDE crawl</li></ul>I'll cover each problem and what my team is doing to solve these issues. I'd love to gather feedback from the audience, to have a better understanding of their pain points and how our strategy aligns with their priorities.</p>"

As developers, we need to know this for a variety of reasons, including because knowing this tells us whether we should be queuing any changes and gives us the ability to return the user to their current experience should the application display be interrupted. But despite it’s crucial nature, codifying the state of an application at any given point in time can often be messy and error prone work. In this talk, we’ll look at the reasons representing state can be problematic, and some practical ways to make it better.</p>"

Bugs were raised and triaged.<br /><br />This session doesn’t cover anything of the above, but will show my approach when migrating the Topeka sample to an instant app with multiple, independent feature modules and what I learned. Topeka is a non-trivial sample application with custom sign in, animations, transitions and several Activities and Fragments.<br /><br />I’ll talk about the steps I took and explain the rationale behind them.

Whether it’s convincing other engineers to adopt Kotlin or convince your design team to create Android mocks, almost any improvement you want to make requires convincing others to make a change.<br /><br />In this talk, we’ll discuss how to effectively create the change you want by focusing on the incentives of others. We’ll start by discussing how to understand what other parties want so that you can make it clear how your initiative helps all stakeholders. Next, we’ll talk about how to identify areas of risk that may prevent your idea from moving forward, as well as how to mitigate that risk. Finally, we’ll discuss the critical role of trust in creating change, and how to use every interaction as a chance to build the trust you need to help you succeed.</p>"

They may look simple and straightforward, but they have a fundamental role in our environment: create a sense of power.<br /><br />We all love to feel empowered and we all hate being frustrated by bad design. Your users know this as well, they want to feel immediately rewarded when they interact with your UI, and they will quickly drop your app if they get annoyed.<br /><br />At Yelp, we get tens of millions button clicks a day. At that kind of scale, every pixel matters. We tune every single aspect of our buttons to make them simple and powerful, but adjusting every single shadow cast, click animation, or color layer can be tricky. In this talk, we will provide a deep dive into the Android framework and the Support Library to understand how buttons are rendered.</p>"

  description: "<p>Imagine the following. You're happily coding along when you suddenly realize that there is a serious security flaw with your app. At first you may be in disbelief. You might turn to your co-worker and ask, “Does this sound right to you?” Then the realization of the magnitude of the problem slowly dawns on you. You might swear, walk outside for fresh air, or even laugh out loud, not knowing how else to respond.<br /><br />Maybe you haven't experienced anything like that. In Clive's talk, you will explore some commonly overlooked areas of Android programming that may pose serious security concerns, so that this doesn't happen to you in the future.<br /><br />Why overlooked? Because most of the issues Clive brings up may seem like it has nothing to do with security, even to an experienced Android developer. Addressing these issues may seem like busy work that someone on the team should do, but no one ends up doing because no time is allotted for it. These issues include, for example, logging, obfuscation, NDK, library dependencies, recent app menu, keystore, etc. Clive's hope for this talk is that we recognize the security implications of these overlooked areas and thus prioritize addressing these issues</p>"

The cost and coverage of running tens of thousands of Espresso tests every day are tracked. We have fragmentation of OS versions and screen sizes. Tests are sharded to reduce build time. Videos of tests are recorded. JUnit test reports are generated. We had to adapt to open source libraries breaking because of new versions of the Android toolchain. This is a multi-technology stack using Android, Bash, Gradle, Cloud Formation, Teamcity, Slack, C++, Python, Groovy, Artifactory... This is about sharing the journey and what we learned along the way, from building internal buy-in to providing feedback to Genymotion itself and the many technical things that broke along the way. We are using this system and plan to expand it with Appium tests for application upgrade and stress testing.</p>"

Data that took a while to load and display is gone and now the app is making the user wait again.<br /><br />All of this is very frustrating to users. But if you know that an Activity is destroyed and then recreated on orientation change, this is not too surprising to you. Still, many beginners don’t know what is going on behind the scenes and consequently come up with flawed or incomplete ways to deal with the lifetime of an Activity.<br /><br />If you have ever “fixed” a bug by changing your app’s manifest to manually handle orientation changes or by locking the device orientation, this talk is for you.

This talk will also cover the difference between Android Lint and other static code analysis tools such as PMD and Findbugs to help you make better decisions on which fits a certain purpose best.<br /><br />Now are you ready to join us and become a Lint Expert?</p>"

  description: "<p>We are now operating in a data-driven world. If your company isn't using metrics to determine what their next step is, then your company is likely moving blindly. That is fairly universally accepted, but what's worse is when what your metrics tell you isn't true. It is very easy for a metric logging error to complete invalidate your conclusion. This talk discusses what we at Pinterest do to avoid this.</p>"
