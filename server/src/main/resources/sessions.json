    "description": "Back in 1974, Donald Knuth said that ‚Äúpremature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming‚Äù. But optimization without benchmarks can be even worse than that. It‚Äôs like following a map without using a compass, and just following your instinct that you‚Äôre going in the right direction. \r\n\r\nWhether it is during development or at runtime, many tools exist to let you measure the performance of your applications. These measures can then be used to prioritize which parts to optimize first, as well as measure the performances gained (or lost) after a refactoring.\r\n",

Even though Kotlin abstracts away much of the virtual machine and the original feature set of Java with its own features, it‚Äôs still important to know what your Kotlin code compiles to. Not only can this knowledge give you the power to optimize your code, but it will also help you avoid subtle bugs that would otherwise be near impossible to track down.",

    "description": "With the latest generation of shiny new Android phones having sometimes up to 12Gb of RAM, it might seem like memory usage concerns are thing of the past. Not so fast. Backwards compatibility is still a thing, and memory can definitely still be a deciding factor when making design decisions for your software. \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to store large bitmaps (or other array-based data) in memory, the estimations are easy enough. However, if you're storing complex structures of objects, the actual memory size of the data can be difficult to evaluate. In this talk, I'll go over the memory structure of the JVM and how much memory an instance of a given class uses. I'll then present a way to examine objects at runtime, to assess exactly how much memory they & the objects they reference are using up. Using this method, I'll look at some data structures that were designed to optimize memory usage, and give an estimate of their real impact over more conventional data structures.",

It gives the developers a chance to develop an app from a single codebase and deploy it for Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web. But not everyone is in the position to abandon an existing codebase and start from scratch - luckily Flutter got you covered even if you just want to extend your existing application with cool Flutter features.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will have a look at how you can add Flutter to your ongoing iOS and Android applications by showing a real-life example app with thousands of users and, we will talk about how you can rewrite your existing applications step by step with Flutter.",

By taking the stance that every piece of code we write is an API we can build more versatile and scalable applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how you can apply best practices from the open-source world to your project, to guard implementations, provide concise and specific contracts, practical documentation mechanisms, and how doing so can aid (or harm) your build time.",

Think about animations, machine learning, functional programming, lambda calculus and many more.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for people who are interested in extending their maths knowledge, building up on existing foundations or starting from scratch. \r\n\r\nWhile it's obviously impossible to teach maths in 40 minutes, this session will look at common areas in which maths help us being better developers and at the pathways to build up the knowledge needed.

    "description": "This talk dives into some of the details of how the new shrinker Google R8 evolved, & how it differs from D8 and Proguard. Android developers know that app size, security and optimization is an important factor in user engagement. In an emerging market like India size of an application matters. The lesser the size the probability of increasing downloads will be more. Smaller is always faster such as download, install, startup. Here comes R8 which is a shrinking technique to shrink your app size. It uses Tree Shaking, Optimization for size, Minification(Obfuscation) techniques.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the outline of the talk:\r\n1. How R8 evolved from Java Compiler, Dex Compiler, Proguard, D8.\r\n2. What are keep rules?\r\n3. What is shrinking in R8?\r\n4. How much you can save using R8?\r\n5. What are R8 shrinking fundamentals?\r\n5. R8 for library developer. \r\n6. Some of the best practices for R8.",

    "description": "Everyone was crazy about annotation processing, but then Kotlin started to appear on the horizon. With Kotlin growing up, developers began to back away from annotation processing gradually, mainly due to its performance issues and the new Kotlin features that were able to replace it in some of the cases. But developers could not get away from it 100% - there were, and are plenty of scenarios when their co-existance with Kotlin is still required. In my talk, I am going to introduce you to how to write and test annotation processors that behave well even in Kotlin projects.",

It‚Äôs even simpler if the task is an http call (thanks to coroutines support in retrofit) or a database query (thanks to Room). The final code is the same we‚Äôd use to execute synchronous code.\r\nBut coroutines are more than just a tool to switch thread, we can use them to execute tasks in parallel. The code is still really easy to read but sometimes it can be difficult to write: we need to pay attention to many aspects (like nested scopes, exceptions and dispatchers). In this talk we‚Äôll see how to leverage the coroutines library to manage parallelism, from the basic concepts to some advanced example.\r\n",

Cela repr√©sente tout autant de r√©cepteurs GPS - ou plut√¥t GNSS ‚Äì et beaucoup d‚Äôapplications n√©cessitent ou utilisent une position. Cela parait simple d‚Äôutiliser les Google Play Services pour r√©cup√©rer une lastLocation ou directement la couche android.location avec un joli onLocationChanged ; et c‚Äôest parfois bien suffisant dans bien des cas, mais pas toujours...\r\n\r\nAlors, comment cette position est-elle construite ? Par quelles entr√©es ? De plus, qu‚Äôest-ce qu‚Äôune position exactement ? Et c‚Äôest quoi la FusedLocation ? On peut tr√®s vite se perdre lorsque l‚Äôon cherche √† se positionner correctement et avec pr√©cision. \r\n\r\nLe framework de localisation Android est complexe et relativement lourd‚Ä¶ Il reste cela dit tr√®s performant et cache pas mal de secrets ! Par exemple, saviez-vous que vous pouvez lire directement le contenu d‚Äôun message envoy√© par les satellites ? Ou encore qu‚Äôon peut utiliser d‚Äôautres sources de donn√©es pour calculer une position, notamment gr√¢ce √† la fusion ?\r\nDurant cette pr√©sentation, nous allons d√©cortiquer la couche android.location et comprendre comment une position est calcul√©e, comment bien utiliser les diff√©rentes callbacks ou m√©thodes qui doivent nous retourner cette position. Mais aussi les diff√©rentes capacit√©s cach√©es du framework, et pourquoi pas une introduction au monde merveilleux du GNSS‚Ä¶ \r\n\r\nEnglish:\r\nToday, we count more than 2.3 billion Android devices in the world. This is as much GPS receivers; or GNSS receivers, and a\r\nlot of application require or use a location. Using Google Play Services looks easy for gathering a lastLocation, or directly through the android.location layer with a nice onLocationChanged; this is often enough. But how this location is computed? Using which inputs? What is truly a location? And what is this FusedLocation everybody talks about ? We can be quickly lost when we search for a precise position.\r\nThe Android‚Äôs framework is complexe, quite heavy, yet, it performs well et hides some secrets. For instance, did you know that you can read the whole content of a satellite message? But also, we can use several sources for positioning using fusion! \r\nDuring this talk, we will be dissecting the android.location layer and understand how a position is calculated. How to use correctly the multiple callbacks or methods available which returns a location. But also, the different hidden ability of the framework, and why an introduction to the wonderful world of GNSS‚Ä¶ \r\n",

We probably all have already used it at least once if only to try it and some talks already answer quite a few questions about it very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to remain mysterious as for the scope of its field of action and implementation for us developers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, can you answer these questions:\r\n\r\n- Can you define what is an interaction with the Assistant?\r\n- What kind of interactions are available?\r\n- How do I build a simple interaction?\r\n- How do I build a more complex, conversation like interaction?\r\n- Can I build a complex visual response through the Assistant?\r\n- Can I ship an interaction to production?\r\n- Can I even build my own interactions?!\r\n\r\nIf you can't, come listen to me talk about the Google Assistant from an Android developer's perspective through actual code and demos.",

User operations spanning multiple screens, flaky network calls, rolling back stale transactions, offline mode support, the list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nFunctional-Reactive architectures have become a popular choice over the last few years to solve these types of problems. But, whether you choose MVVM or MVI, Redux or Flux, RxJava or Flow, React over Flutter over Native development, it shouldn't matter. Aren't there some core ideas you could reuse everywhere?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll be focusing on Unidirectional Data Flow, Immutable Data Stores, State Machines, and error handling strategies. Using these core ideas, we'll build a mental toolbox that you can use in your own Kotlin multi-platform projects.",

In this talk, we'll introduce the benefits of a client side API and understand why this will be the approach of the future. You'll learn what tools are available for consuming GraphQL APIs on Android, and tips for having them coexist with the REST APIs you already support. You'll leave this talk with a clear roadmap on how you can begin migrating your apps to this new technology. ",

Even if you've been using it for a while, the sheer volume of functionality and possibility can be overwhelming. You might have a nagging feeling that you are not using ConstraintLayout in \"the right away\" or at least not using it to its full potential.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we're going to look at common layout problems and ask common layout questions, and start solving them with ConstraintLayout, exploring why and when we might choose some features and functionality over others and building a basic set of tools and techniques. Hopefully, after this talk, ConstraintLayout will feel less overwhelming with a fundamental toolset upon which you can build as you conquer increasingly complex layouts.",
