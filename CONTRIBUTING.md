Thanks for contributing to the Android Makers app ðŸ’š!

We're trying to keep this project up to date with the latest Android tech. It's sometimes using
alpha versions. If you
find something not working, make sure to update all the versions and if that doesn't fix it, report
a bug upstream.

Developing is done using Android Studio.   

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. For any substantial work, it's best to create an issue first and assign it to yourself to avoid duplicating work.
